# mantisbt_for_firebird
The Mantisbt project modified to have connection to Firebird RDBMS
==================================================================

Introduction
============
This is a copy of the [MantisBT Project](https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt) which was addapted to connect to Firebird database.

Despite that the fact the MantisBT Project mainteiners didnt' want to merge the changes that I have made, all modifications work fine.

It can be downloaed and procced with the installation exactly the same way it would be do with the original project.
