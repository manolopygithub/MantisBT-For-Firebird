# mantisbt_for_firebird
The Mantisbt project modified to have connection to Firebird RDBMS
==================================================================

Introduction
============

This is a copy of the [MantisBT Project](https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt) which was addapted to connect to Firebird database.
Despite that the fact the MantisBT Project mainteiners didnt' want to merge the changes that I have made, all modifications work fine.
It can be downloaed and procced with the installation exactly the same way it would be do with the original project.

Documentation
-------------

Please refer to [MantisBT Project](https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt)

Requirements
------------

Please refer to [MantisBT Project](https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt)

Installation
------------

The same way that the [MantisBT Project](https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt).
Nevertheless keep in mind this two items:
- When the Firebird database file does not exist, it must be created first before starting the installation process, because the installation process does NOT create the database file.
- The Firebird RDBMS version must be 4.0 or superior.
