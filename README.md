# mantisbt_for_firebird
The Mantisbt project modified to have connection to Firebird RDBMS
==================================================================

Introduction
============

This is a copy of the [MantisBT Project](https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt) which was addapted to connect to Firebird database.
Despite that the fact the MantisBT Project mainteiners didnt' want to merge the changes that I have made, all modifications work fine.
It can be downloaed and procced with the installation exactly the same way it would be do with the original project.

Documentation
-------------

Pleae refer to [MantisBT Project](https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt)

Requirements
------------

Pleae refer to [MantisBT Project](https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt)

Installation
------------

The same way that the [MantisBT Project](https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt).
The only thing to keep in mind is, when the Firebird database file does not exist, it must be created first before starting the installation process, because the installation process does NOT create the database file.
